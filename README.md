# FinTech Consultancy: Personal Finance & Retirement Planning Tools
Introduction: Welcome to the FinTech Consultancy Project! We are a team dedicated to creating a difference in local communities through impactful FinTech solutions. As our inaugural project, we're working with one of the largest credit unions in the area to develop a prototype application that promotes financial health.

Project Overview: This project consists of two main tools aimed at helping credit union members enhance their financial well-being:

Personal Finance Planner: This tool assists users in visualizing their savings, factoring in investments in shares and cryptocurrencies. This helps assess whether they possess a sufficient emergency fund.

Retirement Planning Tool: Leveraging the Alpaca API, this tool fetches historical closing prices for a retirement portfolio made up of stocks and bonds. It then performs Monte Carlo simulations to project the potential performance of this portfolio over 30 years.
